# Module8-Challenge-Independent-Funding

## Overvirw
This project is an extension of the crowdfunding ETL project. The purpose of this project is to perform an ETL process on the backers dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries. Backerâ€™s contact information is extracted and transformed from a CSV file and added as a new table to crowdfunding_db database. Finally, a data analysis is done on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.

## Resources
Software: Python 3.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.12, pgAdmin 4 6.12
